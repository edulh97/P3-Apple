# Project 3 (and last one for the moment) - "Apple"

This third part of the "Apple" project is based on improving the functions of the product choice questionnaire and storing the configuration on a new page.

On the new page you can consult your chosen configuration and read the return policy by applying a scroll animation.

In addition, more content has been added on the homepage, in the footer and the colour palette and size of the side menu have been improved.

The original model was taken from this page: https://dribbble.com/shots/22859972-Website-Apple-Store
